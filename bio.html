                <section id="paraText">
                    <p> Hi! My name is Anureet Dhaliwal and I am personal trainer based in the Los Angeles area with a
                        masters in
                        fitness medicine
                        and over 10 years in personal training experience. I have owned my own gym (at the age of
                        23)
                        and
                        have competed in various triathlons, but my true calling in one on one personal training.
                        Eventually, I want to open a gym that serves as a rehabilitation center and as a place
                        for
                        children with Austism to be able to workout and maintain healthy lives.
                    </p>

                    <p>My goal orientated lifestyle bleeds into my clients' workouts, as <I></I> strives for the
                        completion of
                        their own goals. Overall, I want my clients to achieve physical, mental, and spiritual
                        health so
                        that they may live their best lives - free from doubt and self consciousness. Whether you want
                        to
                        meet
                        in person or over <i>Zoom,</i> I will put in the work to make sure you get results.
